<h3>For many of us, our morning cup of coffee is something we look forward to every day — sometimes, it's even the highlight of our day. However, it can just as easily be the opposite if it's not made right.</h3><br><br>

	    <li class="font-weight-bold"><b>Impure Water.</b><br>
		Tap water often contains minerals that can alter the flavor of your coffee. Use bottled spring water or filtered drinking water.</li>
	</div><br><br><br>

	<div class="badge badge-primary text-wrap">
		<li class="font-weight-bolder"><b>Not buying it fresh like you would vegetables or bread...</b><br>"One of the key things to explore is to drink your coffee really fresh," he said. "Think about it like fresh bread or vegetables."</li>
	</div><br><br><br>

	<div class="badge badge-danger text-wrap">
		<li class="font-weight-normal"><b>Not making sure your grind size is consistent.</b><br>You can usually buy whole beans or ground coffee suited for a cafetiere, drip, or a stove-top.<br>

		While this means you can successfully brew coffee in any of these methods, he said getting a consistent grind size is the real way to get a "really good brew" out of any method.<br>

		"Relatively small particles are going to over-extract, and make coffee taste more bitter than it should," he said</li>
	</div><br><br><br>

	<div class="badge badge-info text-wrap">
		<li class="font-weight-light"><b>Using a less-than-clean cafetiere.</b><br>"You've got to keep it clean.You don't want to have any old coffee in there — it's just going to add bad flavour to the coffee."</li>
	</div><br><br><br>

	<div class="badge badge-warning text-wrap">
		<li class="font-weight-lighter"><b>Adding milk and sugar when you don't need it.</b><br>
		"Sugar balances out bitterness which you get by over-roasting it, and milk helps to [hide] defects still showing up in the coffee.<br>

		Taking milk and sugar is not a bad thing, it covers up bad flavours coming in the coffee.<br>

		If you buy coffee from a great roaster or someone roasting a bit lighter and taste it before you put milk and sugar in, you might find it doesn't need those two things."</li>
	</div><br><br><br>

	<div class="badge badge-success text-wrap">
		<li class="font-italic">You’re not exploring your options.<br>
		It's easy to get stuck in the daily grind of habitually making or ordering the same drink. Sure, it's ok to have favorites, but you also don't want to limit yourself.<br> If you never switch it up, you may never know that your new favorite morning brew is right around the corner.</li>

	<br><br><h2>There are so many ways and techniques on making coffee, but people are just not aware of them, but there's no way you couldn't enjoy  if you just follow these rules.</h2><br><br>


	<p><i>Pour Over</i></p>
	<ol class="rules">
		<li>First, bring water to a boil in a kettle.</li><br>
		<li>If using whole beans, grind the beans to a uniform consistency similar to granulated table salt.</li><br>
		<li>Meanwhile, put a filter in the brewer and rinse with hot water. This removes the papery residue on the filter and warms up the brewer, keeping your coffee hot for longer. Discard the water used for rinsing.</li><br>
		<li>Add the grounds to the filter, making sure the surface is level. When the water is between 195째F and 205째F (about a minute after removal from heat), slowly and steadily pour just enough water over the grounds to saturate them completely, starting from the middle and working your way outward. Stop pouring before the coffee begins to drip through. This is called the "bloom" pour, which allows the coffee to de-gas.</li><br>
		<li>Slowly pour in the remaining water, keeping the water in the dripper between half and three-quarters full. This should take 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the filter, then serve and enjoy.</li><br><br>
	</ol>
	<p><i>French Press</i></p>
	<ol class="rules">
		<li>First, bring water to a boil in a kettle.</li><br>
		<li>If using whole beans, grind the beans to a consistency similar to breadcrumbs (coarser than you'd want for pour-over). The grounds should be uniform in size, without a lot of fine grit. Add the grounds to the French press.</li><br>
		<li>When the water is between 195째F and 205째F (about a minute after removal from heat), add it to the French press and stir it vigorously into the grounds. Brew for about 4 minutes, then slowly plunge the press, separating the grounds from the coffee.</li><br>
		<li>Serve and enjoy. Note: if you're not planning on drinking the coffee immediately, do not leave it in the French press, as it will continue to sit on the grounds and become bitter. Instead, pour the coffee into a carafe to enjoy later.</li><br><br>
	</ol>
	<p><i>Drip</i></p>
	<ol class="rules">
		<li>If using whole beans, grind the beans to a uniform consistency similar to granulated table salt. Transfer the grounds into a filter, then place in the drip machine. Swivel water spout over the center of the grounds.</li><br>
		<li>Pour clean water into the back of the machine (not over the grounds) and press the on button.</li><br>
		<li>Turn off the machine as soon as the coffee is done brewing (it will stop bubbling) to avoid a burnt taste. Be sure to clean your machine once a month by filtering through a mixture of water and vinegar, which removes any built-up residue</li><br>
